A package of modules to process and analyze neural recordings as individual voltage time series. The primary purpose of this library is to serve as the shared codebase for the [Voytek Lab](http://voyteklab.com/), but we welcome anyone's use and contributions.

## Python version support
This package has been tested on python 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 with the latest [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution. Support for python 2 and earlier versions of python 3 is not guaranteed.

## Get latest code

`$ git clone https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp.git`

## Install latest release of neurodsp

`$ pip install neurodsp`
