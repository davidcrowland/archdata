"# archdata"
This is a repository for loading and analyzing the data presented in our paper "Functional properties of stellate cells in the Medial Entorhinal Cortex Layer II" You can find the notebooks as a Binder by following the link below:

Use "tagged cells" to reproduce figure 3 and "extended dataset" to reproduce figure 4. You can access the notebooks either on GitHub or through Binder. These notebooks load in the .pkl files located here on GitHub. 

If you open the data through Binder, you should be able to run the code through a web browser (tested on Google Chrome). If you are not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, click "kernel" and then "restart and run all". This will execute the whole notebook. The notebook includes key plots and statistics used in our study. You can edit the code and replot however you want, as long as the required functions are available on the pre-loaded packages (most of the essentials are there: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn pycircstat, etc.)
